Deploy/Setup contracts instructions:
  1. Deploy SatToken.sol using these parameters: "splyt", "splyt token contract", 4
  2. Deploy SplytTracker.sol using these parameters: 4, "splyt", [SatToken contract address from step 1]
  3. Call SatToken.setTrackerAddr function to set SplytTracker address: [SplytTracker contract address from step 2]
  
Everything is setup at this point.


Creating a Fractional listing:
  1. Call SplytTracker.createAsset function to create an asset: "0x5a396abf23663a0013fbb0b3", 1, "WEEK", "Coffee for sale", 350, 1621239891, "0x951d59b8Be3bfe2473572F04E3aFe315D48E2c3B", 4
  2. Call SplytTracker.getAddressById function to get asset's contract address from step 1: "0x5a396abf23663a0013fbb0b3"
  3. Create an asset contract by using the returned address from step 2: "0x30e03f3a791a981a6b471b9d6e2a332f9805e021"

Contributing to a Fractional Listing:
  1. Call Asset.contribute function using these parameters: "0xd9e5e4bde24faa2b277ab2be78c95b9ae24259a8", 4, "0x951d59b8be3bfe2473572f04e3afe315d48e2c3b", 30


TOOD: 
 - Asset.seller is 0x000000..0 instead of seller wallet address
 - Asset.isOpenForContributions should also check if incoming contribution will go over the total value, if it will revert()
 - Asset.contribute don't allow 3rd person to contribute using your wallet address.

Discussion:
 - Season tickets expires end of year/end of 12 month finished. House never expires. You own xx% of it forever.
 - If house is fractionally listed, for 365 days aka 1 year, the only slots and term combo that works is 1 day slot, 365 days term; 5 days slot, 365 days term.
